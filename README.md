# coffeeOrderApp
This is a coffee ordering android application. The same can be implemetned for various food products.


On monthly basis, I visit a place called "Burgers" with my friends, which is one of the most popular places to have burgers in Pune, Maharashtra, India. 
I have only one issue with their service i.e they have very long queues. Sometimes it takes more than 30 minutes just to order.
So, I have developed a model where customers no longer need to wait in the long queue. They can take a seat and scan a nearby QR code which would download the order application following that they can order burgers directly there on the app and the food will arrive at their table once prepared. 

Test QR code file also uploaded named "qrScan.jpg".

APK: app/app-debug_V2.apk
